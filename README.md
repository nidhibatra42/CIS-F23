main.py - This is how our program is executed. In this file, the name of the folder and file name are specified according to which set of data you chose to run. The appropriate methods (problems 4, 5, and 6) are called to create our output file with the data we generate. 

CalReadings.py -  This class reads calibration data from a specified file, processes it, and organizes it into
three different lists based on marker types (Base Markers, OptCal Markers, and EMCal Markers).

EMPivot.py- This is a class we wrote for processing EM pivot data. 

OptPivot.py- This is a class we wrote for processing optical tracking data.
